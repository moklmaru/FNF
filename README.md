# Friday Night Funkin' - ??? Engine

this is my personal playground for now as i slowly end up rewriting this game's entire engine (more or less. obviously its a ton of copied/adapted code; i'm not special)

maybe i'll name it something eventually. but it is using Psych Engine as a base while also integrating V-Slice/P-Slice features, random other things i decide to steal from public engines, and even my own stuff

big goal of mine, mostly for my own satisfaction, is to clean up a ton of repo organization and implement more intuitive modding framework. whats there is pretty good but it can be so much better

but above all else i'm just making this as swag as i can


coding goals (mainly for personal reference):
 - all ported code should be natively integrated into the existing codebase. it seems to be common practice when porting stuff from v-slice/official funkin to just dump the code in a new files/folder without regard to its dependencies, then just fixing errors until it compiles and you ignore it. that is not good! keep it clean
 - clean up variable/funkin names in general
 - comment comment comment!
 - unify various objects and structures to be more intuitive, efficient, and minimal
